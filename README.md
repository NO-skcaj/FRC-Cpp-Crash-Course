# Welcome to the 1771 Programming Crash Course. 

### This is a WIP by Joseph Farkas. 

The current structure will have folders marking "chapters" of the documentation. 

It will start by introducing the basics of C++ so that anyone with a little time can learn enough C++ to read and understand the following documentation and at least some of the codebase. **You don't have to know much to get started and contribute to our code; you'll learn as you help!** 

The second chapter will go over some of the more common libraries we use in our code. 

Additional chapters may come in the future.

The aim of this documentation is to provide anyone who wishes to contribute a great place to start and understand not just the WHAT, but also the WHY behind the code. If you do start contributing to the code base, try to follow the Edit Guidelines (located in the repo) as having consistent style makes the code easier to read for others. 

Don't hesitate to try something out and see if it works, nothing you do will ever ruin our code as we have git history.
