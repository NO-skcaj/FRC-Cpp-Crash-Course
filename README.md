# Welcome to our C++ Programming Crash Course.

### This is based on reasources made by Joseph Farkas on team 1771.

**The crash course is contained in the "[Wiki](https://github.com/TEAM1771/Crash-Course/wiki)" section on our GitHub repo.**

It will start by introducing the basics of C++ so that anyone with a little time can learn enough C++ to read and understand the following documentation and at least some of the codebase. 

**You don't have to know much to get started and contribute to our code; you'll learn as you help!** 

The second chapter will go over some of the more common libraries we use in our code. 

Additional chapters may come in the future.

## Get Involved!
The aim of this documentation is to provide anyone who wishes to contribute a great place to start and understand not just the *what*, but also the *why* behind the code.

**Don't hesitate to try something out and see if it works, nothing you do will ever ruin our code as we have git history!**

**If you're looking for a project to help out with, please ask in #programming in Slack or come to a meeting to get added to our GitHub group, and then check out the Issues tab on the repo for our robot's code.**
