# Welcome to our C++ Programming Crash Course.

This is based on reasources made by Joseph Farkas on team 1771.

**The crash course is contained in the "[Wiki](https://github.com/NO-skcaj/FRC-Cpp-Crash-Course/wiki)" section on this repo.**

It will start by introducing the basics of C++ so that anyone with a little time can learn enough C++ to read and understand the following documentation and at least some of the codebase. 
The second chapter will go over some of the more common libraries we use in our code. 

Additional chapters may come in the future.

## Get Involved!
The aim of this documentation is to provide anyone who wishes to contribute a great place to start and understand not just the *what*, but also the *why* behind the code.

**Don't hesitate to try something out and see if it works, nothing you do will ever ruin our code as we have git history!**
